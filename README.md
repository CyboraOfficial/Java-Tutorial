# Java-Tutorial

I don't know why I make this, because I don't know much about java.
This is for my documentation only. If you have tips or somthing else pls let me know.

Pls don't take this for you as a tutorial, get to a professionel website, like linked below.

In this .java file I show all sorts of things about java. 
If you think of something or I have to add something please let me know.

This project is inspired by https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp.
